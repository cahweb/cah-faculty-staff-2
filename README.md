# CAH Faculty and Staff Plugin v2.0.0
This is a plugin designed to provide a page template for a CAH Faculty and Staff page, so that we can have a uniform display across the entire CAH family of sites.

## Before You Apply This Template...
Once you activate the plugin, make sure that you have either defined a constant named `DEPT` in your functions.php file or you go and set your Department in the "Faculty/Staff Options" menu (found under "Settings"). ***The plugin won't work unless it knows which department it's looking forâ€”it's not going to pull hundreds of people for no reason.***

## After the DEPT Constant Is Set
Things should be pretty plug-and-play. There are a few other options on the Options page (which are fairly self-explanatory), but for the most part, you can just create the page you want to use as your Faculty/Staff page and set the template to "Faculty and Staff Template."
